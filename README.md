# FriendFinder
An app to match someone to someone else via a simple survey.

## Goal
The purpose of this project was to create a lightweight web app that matched users based on a survey. 

## Technologies
This page was created using node.js and Express for the backend, and jQuery, vanilla CSS and HTML for the front end.

## Future Development
The next step would be to create an actual SQL database for storing and retrieving friend scores. Additionally, if the Friend database begins to grow, many friends with identical scores would start to exist. In other words, a user might be identically matched to two different friends, which currently would result in a match to whichever friend was added to the database first. We would need to develop a way to choose from these matches, perhaps simply at random. Lastly, the ultra-repetitive HTML could be improved with Handlebars.
